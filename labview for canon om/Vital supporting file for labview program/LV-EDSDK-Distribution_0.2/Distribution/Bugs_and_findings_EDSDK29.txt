Bugs (mostly documentation) in EDSDK v2.9
=========================================


EdsDownloadEvfImage:
--------------------

  The SDK manual (v2.9) reports a call form

    EdsError EdsDownloadEvfImage (EdsCameraRef outStream, EdsEvfImageRef outEvfImage)

  in which the argument names are misleading (their types are more suggestive).
  EDSDK.h has the correct prototype with better argument names:

    EdsError EdsDownloadEvfImage (EdsCameraRef inCameraRef, EdsEvfImageRef inEvfImageRef) ;

  Moreover, this routine has to be called with C conventions and not stdcall 
  (http://canonsdk.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=821&p=1172)


EdsCreateEvfImageRef:
---------------------

  This routine has to be called with C conventions and not stdcall 
  (http://canonsdk.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=821&p=1172)

  The stream created by this function becomes filled with a plain string
  containing the live view image encoded as JPEG. The image can be decoded
  by EdsGetImage (see comments below), or feeded to any other JPEG decoder.
  This is known to the neswgroups but undocumented.


EdsGetImage, EdsDownload and EdsDownloadThumbnail:
--------------------------------------------------

  The argument outStreamRef is an input argument, despite its name. The stream
  is supposed to have already been created by, e.g. EdsCreateMemoryStream.


EdsGetImage:
------------

  The output stream format of EsdGetImage is undocumented. By trial and error it appears
  that for the EOS550D, all the interesting RGB picture data is located just at the end of the stream.
  For that, in live wiew mode, inImageSource has to be set as "Thumbnail", and when retrieving
  normal pictures, as "FullView". The use of other combinations is unknown to me. The initial part 
  of the stream likely contains important data, but I'm not aware of a documentation of which, nor
  of any useful function which unpacks efficiently all the content of the stream.
  As a JPEG decoder, the performance of EdsGetImage is probably not the best. I achieved
  ~ 10% more throughput with the routine found on http://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-13513 .


EdsGetDirectoryItemInfo:
------------------------

  The SDK manual (v2.9) describes the member "format" of the structure
  DirectoryItemInfo as of type EdsImageType (correctly), However, immediately
  afterwards it reports a table for the enum EdsImageTargetType, which is not the same
  (confusing)


Typos in EDSDKTypes.h:
----------------------

*definition of the EdsImageQuality enum: 
    EdsImageQuality_SJN = 0x0213ff0f, /* Jpeg Small Normal */
  would coincide with the value of EdsImageQuality_SJF. Comparing with the
  neighboring definitions, it looks likely that the intended value is 0x0212ff0f.


Undocumented functions
----------------------

in EDSDK.dll: EdsDownloadCtgInfo and EdsCreateCtgInfoRef. Across the net, I found hints that .ctg files
are index files on camera which contain information about how pictures are stored.
